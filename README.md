## General info

When a someone new to brussels arrive the first time they are pretty much confused due to the excessively amount of things such as: people, common transportation, places of interest, restaurants, etc. People get overwhelmed by this, so we help them presenting through our platform and an interactive map the following features

- Multiple filters such as: Toilets, restaurants, hotels, places of interest, etc.
- The possibilty to toggle on/off filters to provide them exactly what they're looking for
- The platform provides also a selection of places
  that tourist must see in they are visiting Brusels
- The option to review places and review others recommendations through an account function.

The platform will include a search bar that will help people filter the specific information they are looking for
